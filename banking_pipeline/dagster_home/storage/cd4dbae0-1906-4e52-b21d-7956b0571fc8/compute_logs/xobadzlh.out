[0m06:44:50  [[33mWARNING[0m]: Use revamped materializations based on separating create and insert.  This allows more performant column comments, as well as new column features.
You may opt into the new behavior sooner by setting `flags.use_materialization_v2` to `True` in `dbt_project.yml`.

[0m06:44:50  [[33mWARNING[0m]: Use managed Iceberg tables when table_format is iceberg. When this flag is disabled, UniForm is used instead.
